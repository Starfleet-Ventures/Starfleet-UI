    <h3 [ngStyle.gt-md]="{'font-size': '17px'}"> We at Starfleet are designing AI driven Data visualisation technologies that would contribute in achieving environmental sustainability on a global scale every day. We aspire to provide the Canadian and US industry with AI-based analytics to go green and generate energy in off-grid conditions. Starfleet's unique advantages have put us at the forefront of monitoring forests, oil wells, shipping lanes, and strategic infrastructure.
      As we transition towards a net-zero future, the oil, mining, and forestry sectors will play a crucial role in our green recovery. While Canadian and US industry needs to extract natural resources, we would help them improve their efficiency and enhance environmental performance.
